## Overview
### Description
JamSesh is a music app where you can create music sessions from your playlists. These music sessions can be a a space for you to listen music with friends or meet new people with similar music interests. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be developed for mobile, but it could potentially work as effectively on computers.
- **Story:** This app would allow people to listen to music as well as connect and socialize with other people who have similar music interests through music sessions. The user can create music session or join other music session and chat with fellow users within that session.
- **Market:** Anyone who loves music can enjoy this app. Ability to follow other users allow a user to discover new songs and interact with other users by joining their session.
- **Habit:** Users can listen to music anytime they want. The feature “Music Sessions” could also encourage users to use this app more often as it allows them to chat with their friends and listen to the same music at the same time.
- **Scope:** At the moment, JamSesh is simply for listening to music and chatting with the people the user is following. Perhaps, it could eventually allow users to view popular music sessions based on location.
